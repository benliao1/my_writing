Im speziellen wurden Schaltungen angegeben, die Wechselspannung in Gleichspannung vom vielfachen Betrag der Scheitelspannung umwandeln. An einer Reihe von Schaltungen wurden die praktisch erzielten Spannungen mit den theoretisch zu erwartenden verglichen. Durch Aufnahme von Oszillogrammen konnte ferner die Theorie über die Wirkungsweise der neuen Schaltungen auch experimentell verifiziert werden. Im besonderen ließ sich zeigen, daß die sich ausbildende Gleichspannung durch stufenweise (asymptotische) Aufladung der Kondensatoren im Laufe vieler Perioden (theoretisch 8 viele) erreicht wird.},

In general, power electronics is the process of using semiconductor switching devices to control and convert electrical power flow from one form to another to meet a specific need. These conversion techniques have revolutionized modern life by streamlining manufacturing processes, increasing product efficiencies, and increasing the quality of life by enhancing many modern conveniences such as computers, and they can help to improve the delivery of reliable power from utilities. This report summarizes the technical challenges associated with utilizing power electronics devices across the entire spectrum from applications to manufacturing and materials development, and it provides recommendations for research and development (R&D) needs for power electronics systems in which the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) could make a substantial impact toward improving the reliability of the bulk power system.},

  Abstract                 = {Switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC power converters are a subset of DC-DC power converters that use a network of switches and capacitors to efficiently convert one voltage to another. Unlike traditional inductor-based DC-DC converters, SC converters do not rely on magnetic energy storage. This fact makes SC converters ideal for integrated implementations, as common integrated inductors are not yet suitable for power electronic applications. While they are only capable of a finite number of conversion ratios, SC converters can support a higher power density compared with traditional converters for a given conversion ratio. Finally, through simple control methods, regulation over many magnitudes of output power is possible while maintaining high efficiency.
A complete, detailed methodology for SC converter analysis, optimization and implementation is derived. These methods specify device choices and sizing for each capacitor and switch in the circuit, along with the relative sizing between switches and capacitors. This method is advantageous over previously-developed analysis methods because of its simplicity and the intuition it lends towards the design of SC converters. The strengths and weaknesses of numerous topologies are compared amongst themselves and with magnetics-based converters. These methods are incorporated into a MATLAB tool for converter design.
This design methodology is applied to three varied applications for SC converters. First, a high-voltage hybrid converter for an autonomous micro air vehicle is described. This converter, weighing less than 150mg, creates a supply of 200V from a single lithium-ion cell (3.7V) to supply the aircraft's actuators. Second, a power-management integrated circuit (IC) is presented for a wireless sensor node. This IC, with a target quiescent current of 1 uA, supplies the system voltages of the PicoCube wireless sensor node. Finally, the initial design of a high-current-density SC voltage regulator is presented for low-footprint microprocessor applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Conventional switched capacitor converters have an inherent drawback that their efficiency is much decreased as the output current is increased. This inherent drawback is due to a periodical forced charging and discharging operation in the internal switched capacitors accompanied by a large capacitor current, so that their efficiency can not be increased by decreasing its internal resistance. As a result, conventional switched capacitor converters have been limited to be used with a very small output current. This paper presents some novel switched capacitor converter topologies that use a resonant operation instead of the forced charging and discharging operation. Their advantage over conventional switched capacitor converters is a high efficiency even in a high output current region. The operation analysis and steady-state characteristics are described in detail for a half-buck type switched capacitor converter, and they are confirmed by experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {Current stress is usually high for conventional switched-capacitor converter circuits, because of short-circuiting when charging up the capacitors. In this paper, two zero-current switching switched-capacitor resonant step-down converter families are presented which can improve the current stress problem. They are able to provide 1/2 to 1/n, and -1 to -1/n conversion ratios respectively by using only two switches. Principles of operation, computer simulation and experimental results of the proposed converters are presented. The measured efficiency is high and all parts of the circuits are under zero-current switching conditions},
