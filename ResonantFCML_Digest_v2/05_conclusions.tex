\vspace{-0.75em}
This work derives the closed-form solution for the phase durations required to operate an $N$:1 FCML at- and above-resonance, while simultaneously minimizing rms inductor current ripple for reduced overall converter loss. Furthermore, a general method for analyzing above-resonance behavior of hybrid switched-capacitor converters has been presented. The hardware prototype results for the 5:1 FCML converter match simulation closely and confirm the presented operation mode. The final paper will include further derivation details as well as additional hardware results.
