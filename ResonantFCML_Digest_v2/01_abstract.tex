\noindent \textbf{{\small Abstract}} -- {\small The flying capacitor multilevel (FCML) converter has shown promise for high step-up/down conversion ratios due to its relatively low switch stress and small inductor volume.
For higher level-count ($N\geq3$) variations of this topology, there is limited research on resonant mode operation, despite its promise to yield considerable performance benefits. Using resonant mode operation, magnetic volume may be further reduced, transient response increased, and zero-voltage/zero-current switching (ZCS/ZVS) enabled at the cost of fixed conversion ratio operation.
This work presents and analyzes a clocking scheme required to operate an $N$:1 FCML converter both at-resonance and above-resonance, while maintaining minimum current ripple for reduced losses. A complete derivation is presented, enabling the calculation of precise phase durations as a function of switching frequency. 
Moreover, a 5:1 FCML hardware prototype is demonstrated, verifying intended operation both at and above resonance, in addition to highlighting the achievable loss reduction with the proposed switching scheme. }
